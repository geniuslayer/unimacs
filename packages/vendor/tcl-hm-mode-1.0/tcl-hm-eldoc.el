;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This implements eldoc support in tcl-hm-mode.  eldoc is a built-in
;; Emacs mode for displaying documentation about a symbol or function
;; call at point in the message buffer (see `eldoc-mode').
;;
;; To use:
;;
;; Enable the minor mode `tcl-hm-eldoc', as well as `eldoc-mode'. For
;; an example, place point on top of a symbol, or inside a function
;; call.
;;
;; It is easiest to add `tcl-hm-eldoc' to `tcl-hm-mode-hook', if you
;; already have `tcl-hm-mode' set up.
;;
;; Notes:
;;
;; - It is based on tcl-hm-mode and modified from irony-eldoc.

eldoc is a built-in Emacs mode for displaying documentation about
a symbol or function call at point in the message buffer (see
`eldoc-mode').

To use:

- Enable the minor mode `tcl-hm-eldoc', as well as
  `eldoc-mode'. For an example, place point on top of a symbol,
  or inside a function call.

- It is easiest to add `tcl-hm-eldoc' to `tcl-hm-mode-hook', if you
  already have `tcl-hm-mode' set up.

Notes:

- Sometimes the information `tcl-hm-eldoc' uses can go out of
